End Goal: To make a BlackJack game with 3 AIs

How the game works
    1. Start Game - click start game button
        -Start amount: $500 (for everyone)
    2. Player and AIs make their bets. 1 or 2 chips. ($10 chips)
        -AI1 will bet riskier = 2 chips
        -AI2 will bet safer = 1 chip
    3. 2 face up cards are dealt to the player and AIs. Dealer has 1 card and 1 card down.
        -deal order: left to right, dealer last
    4. Player, AI and Dealer make decision to hit or stand.
        -AI1 (risky) will hit if under 17, stand above
        -AI2 (safety) will hit if under 14, stand above
        -**coding for dealer will be tricky...how to do this?**
    5. Assess if player or AIs beat Dealer
    6. Payouts for wins and loses
        -3:2 for BJ wins
    7. Repeat steps until end game
        -Break if money = 0
        -Player can keep playing

    Dealer Win Scenario (Loses)
        -Per play: if player/AIs are over 21, dealer can be over and under 21 (bust)
        -Whole Game loss: money = $0
        -If AI money reaches to $0, they can go negative amount

    Player/AI Win Scenarios (Win)
        -if player/AIs are higher than dealer, but not over 21
        -if player/AIs immediately get 21
            -payout 3:2
    
    What BlackJack will not include
        -splitting
        -betting over 3 chips
